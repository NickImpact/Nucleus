# API Changes

## Added  `NucleusTextTemplate#getBody(CommandSource... sender)` and companion methods

In order to support sending broadcasts to Discord when using MagiBridge, the `NucleusTextTemplate` that is returned 
from `NucleusTextTemplateEvent#getMessage()` now has a set of `getBody` methods to support getting unprefixed messages.
